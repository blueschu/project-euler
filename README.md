# Project Euler Solutions
This repository contains an assortment of solutions to problems from [Project Euler][euler]. 

I am using these problems to help myself gain familiarity with various programming languages. As of this writing, I have only written solutions in Python, Haskell, and Go, though others langauges might follow in the future.
