# Project Euler Solutions
This repository contains an assortment of solutions to problems from [Project Euler][euler]. 

I am using these problems to help myself gain familiarity with the standard libraries and general workflow of various programming languages. I expect that many of my solutions are rather naive as my experience with most of these languages is limited. As I've come to grasp a few best practices, I have modified a few of my solutions. Still, I expect that each language directory exhibits a fairly evident learning curve.

I had no particular focus in mind while writing these solutions. Brevity, efficiency, and readability were all valued, but I took no philosophical approach as to which should be most evident in my work.

For now, I have only produced solutions with Python and Haskell, though others are apt to follow.
