# Project Euler Solutions
This repository contains an assortment of solutions to problems from [Project Euler][euler]. 

I am using these problems to help myself gain familiarity with various programming languages. As of this writing, I have only written solutions in Python and Haskell, though others langauges are apt to follow in the future.

I had no particular focus in mind while writing these solutions. Brevity, efficiency, and readability were all considered, but I make not attempt to prioritize one over another.
